"""
- Used for searching ordered lists
- Has a time complexity of O(log n)

** Searching procedure **
- Start with two indexes at the beginning and end of the list
- Calculate the midpoint using the two indexes.
- Check if the value at the midpoint is the required value.
- If it is the required value, quit and return the number,
- If not the required value, and is less than the required value, advance the lower index to the midpoint position and calculate a new midpoint
- If midpoint is greater tha the required value, reduce the upper index to the midpoint position and again recalculate a new midpoint
