** Overview **
- A divide and conquer algorith like the merge sort
- Uses recursion to divide data
- Generally performs better than the merge sort O(n log n)
- Operates in place of the data
- Worst case is O(n^2) where the data is mostly sorted already

** Implementation **
- A pivot position is picked
- Points that are at the wrong side of the pivot value are picked and moved to their respective sides
- A point where the array is to be brocken is figured out.
